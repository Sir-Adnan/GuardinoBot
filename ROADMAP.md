# ROADMAP — Guardino-Bot

> Living plan: phases, status, backlog. **CLAUDE.md** = stable "how to work here"
> (auto-loaded every session, keep it lean). **README.md** = public/user docs.
> **This file** = the changing roadmap — read it only when working on a roadmap item.
> English on purpose (fewer tokens). Bot UI strings stay Persian.

## How to use this file

- New idea → drop a one-liner under **Backlog**. When we commit to it, promote it to a
  **Phase** (own `### Phase N` block: goal, scope, files, decisions) and move to **Now**.
- A phase ships → compress it to one ✅ line under **Done log** (keep just enough so nobody
  re-scans the repo or rebuilds it), and delete its detailed block.
- Status markers: `[ ]` todo · `⏳` in progress · `✅` done · `⚠️` caveat · `⛔` deferred.
- Keep lines short and scannable. Don't paste code here; point to files (`path:sym`).

---

## Now — stabilization + leftovers

P5–P13 shipped; crypto v2 (Plisio + NowPayments) + the offline crypto gateway are live; the
multi-bot installer and premium inline buttons are owner-verified on a real server. Shipped
detail lives in the **Done log** + the **Pxx blocks** below.

**Current focus (in order):**

1. [ ] **Card-to-card web gateway-config** — extend `GET/PATCH /payment-gateways` +
   `pages/gateways` to card-to-card (cards CRUD, verify-before-show, auto-accept flags; secrets
   masked, super-admin, audited). ⛔ Rial online gateways (zarinpal/zibal/payping/aqaye-pardakht)
   dropped — owner: unused.
2. [ ] Web-panel minors (detail in the Pxx blocks): P5b discount/menu attach UI + drag reorder ·
   P9b reseller/usage/refund breakdowns + Excel export · P11a shell/breadcrumbs + server-side
   Appearance defaults · P11b micro-interactions + broader audit · P7 orders view · P8 reseller
   wallet/permission flags.
3. [ ] Deferred infra: aiogram bump (`parse_mode=` ctor → `DefaultBotProperties`) · Guardino
   reserves + efficient paginated sync + `on_hold` create · PasarGuard native
   `reset_proxy_credentials` · brand migration `marzbot`/`Marzdemo` → Guardino · observability
   (structured metrics/logs for panel + gateway errors).

Recently fixed (2026-07-02):

- ✅ purchase.py — missing `await main_menu_handler(...)` + stray `show_alert` on a `Message` reply.
- ✅ Referral gift no longer burned by a free/test first purchase — the one-time gift waits for
  the invitee's first PAID purchase (`gift_amount > 0` guard, int amount).
- ✅ "Unused subscription" alert button now sends the single **Sub link** (new `links_sub` action +
  `proxy_sub_link` handler, QR link-preview) instead of the noisy per-config list.
- ✅ Plisio legacy `/plisio` view — ~90 lines of dead post-`return` code + unused imports removed
  (clean delegation to the v2 handler).
- ✅ config.py — **fail-fast** when `SECRET_KEY_STRING` is default/blank on a non-sqlite DB
  (forgeable web-JWT guard; sqlite dev = warn only) + `DEFAULT_DAILY_TEST_SERVICES` env-name typo
  fixed (old misspelling kept as fallback). `.env.example` + CLAUDE.md/architecture docs updated.
- ✅ Web users API — **role guard** `_ensure_manageable` on block + edit: write actions only on a
  STRICTLY lower role (an admin could block the owner → bot+web lock-out recoverable only via DB,
  or self-grant postpaid credit). Balance adjust stays super-only.
- ✅ Plisio + NowPayments finalizers — read-then-save replaced with the **atomic conditional
  update** (`filter(status__not_in=…).update(status=finished)`); only the claimer notifies +
  activates, so a callback racing the manual-check button can no longer double-activate.
  Exclusion sets preserved per module (Plisio also excludes `partially_paid`; NowPayments doesn't —
  manual approve of a review payment is intended).
- ✅ Dead `middlewares/rate_limit.py` (never registered, latent TypeError) **deleted**; live
  throttling stays `utils/rate_limit.py` (`RateLimit` + `lock()`).

---

## Planned phases — web-panel maturity + bot UX (P5–P13)

> Scope rule (unchanged): web panel = manage/support/report/customize + audit, through the
> Panel adapter (`docs/panels.md`). **No manual sell** (provisioning a sub stays bot-only); defining plans/prices is
> management and IS allowed. Never expose panel/payment/DB credentials. Reseller scoping holds.

### P5 — Plans & Sales: full CRUD + ordering (web)

**P5a — ✅ done:** edit (all simple fields + 8 flags + reset_strategy + flow + button emoji/style),
**reorder** (↑↓ → `POST /services/reorder`, priority=index), **delete** (guarded: 409 if proxies/
reserves reference it — Proxy=SET_NULL, Reserve=RESTRICT), **duplicate** (`POST /{id}/duplicate`
clones provisioning as a non-purchaseable draft → edit; M2M not copied). `services` router gained
`GET /{id}` (ServiceDetail) + PATCH/DELETE/duplicate/reorder, all audited; web Services page = full
edit modal (GB/days inputs) + PageHeader. data_limit↔GB, expire↔days handled in the form.
**P5b — ✅ create-from-scratch:** `POST /services` (validates server + fields; provisioning stored
as-shaped) + `GET /services/provisioning?server_id=` — a **live** panel-catalog fetch (`build_panel().
get_inbounds()` with an 8s timeout; errors → non-sensitive codes). Web Services page: **New service**
button → create modal with a **server picker** that lazy-loads the catalog and a **panel-aware
provisioning picker** — Marzban inbounds (+ "all inbounds" switch) · PasarGuard **groups** ·
Guardino **nodes** (+ pricing mode) → assembles `inbounds`/`all_inbounds` or `panel_config`; audited
`service.create`. Reuses the edit modal for all other fields.
**P5b — remaining (minor):** discount/menu attach UI + true drag-and-drop reorder. (↑↓ reorder works.)

### P6 — Panels & Nodes: full CRUD (web)

**P6 core — ✅ done:** add panel (validates the connection via the panel adapter `fetch_token`/`login` +
`validate` BEFORE saving — Marzban/PasarGuard token flow, Guardino reseller login with a clear
"disable 2FA" error), edit (re-connects + refreshes the token when host/port/https/username/
password change), delete (**blocked** if services/proxies attached — FK is CASCADE, would wipe
live subs), `link_policy` (Guardino), health + enable/disable (existing). Credentials stored
encrypted (`PasswordField`), password/token **never returned**; all audited (`server.add/update/
delete`). `servers` router gained `GET /{id}` (ServerDetail) + POST/PATCH/DELETE; web Servers page
= add/edit modal (panel picker, host/port/https, creds, link policy) + PageHeader.
**P6b — ✅ done via P5b:** the provisioning endpoint + picker browse PasarGuard groups /
Guardino nodes (`GET /services/provisioning`).

### P7 — Users 360°: detail + actions (web) — ✅ done

- **Detail page, tabbed**: Overview · Subscriptions · Transactions · Logs (Logs = super-only,
  via `/audit?target_type=user&target_id=`). List already shows id + username (search by either).
- **Overview actions**: block/unblock; **Edit** (role [super-only escalation guard], postpaid +
  credit, daily-test count, discount %, username prefix → `PATCH /users/{id}`, audit `user.update`);
  **Adjust balance** (super-only: charge→`Transaction(by_admin,finished)` / decharge→`Invoice(by_admin)`,
  mirroring the bot so stats stay exact, audit `balance.adjust`).
- **Subscriptions tab**: their proxies via `/proxies?user_id=` + enable/disable/reset/revoke/delete
  (reuses the panel-adapter-backed proxy action/delete endpoints, audited).
- Backend: `users` router gained `PATCH /{id}` + `POST /{id}/balance`; `UserDetail` enriched
  (postpaid credit, test count, discount %, prefix, parent/referrer); `audit` got a `target_id` filter.
- **Remaining (minor):** a dedicated Orders view (currently Transactions covers payments); reseller
  scoping already applies to the detail (resellers see only their subtree).

### P8 — Resellers: full management (web) — ✅ done

- **Promote** an existing user → reseller (`POST /resellers/promote` by id/@username, super-only,
  audited) from the list.
- **Detail = console** (tabbed: Overview · Sub-users · Subscriptions): edit (role/postpaid/credit
  limit/discount %/test count/prefix) + **balance adjust** — reuses the P7 `users` PATCH + balance
  endpoints (super-only, audited, same Transaction/Invoice math). Sub-users via
  `GET /resellers/{id}/children`; subscriptions via `/proxies?user_id=`.
- **Remaining (minor):** dedicated wallet/margin model beyond discount %, explicit permission
  flags, and read-only **"view as reseller"** impersonation (deferred — needs auth scoping).

### P9 — Reports & Analytics: complete + Jalali (web) — ✅ core done

- **Date range**: `/reports/summary` now takes `start`/`end` (ISO) overriding `days`; correct
  `created_at__gte/__lt` bounds + range echoed back. Web: preset Segmented (7/30/90) **+ custom
  RangePicker** + range shown in the header.
- **Metrics**: added **failed/incomplete payments** (non-finished tx in range) as a 5th KPI;
  Sales · Income · Orders · New users · Failed already covered; payment breakdown + top services.
- **Jalali display**: series tooltips + header range render via `formatDay` (P11a util) → follows
  the global calendar toggle. **CSV export** of KPIs + breakdown + series.
- **Remaining (P9b):** Reseller/Usage/Refunds report breakdowns + Excel export. (The Jalali
  range picker shipped in P11b.)

### P10 — Finish the half-done pages (web) — ✅ done

- ✅ **Discounts**: full CRUD — `discounts` router POST/PATCH/DELETE (percentage 0..100 guard,
  auto-generated code, unique-code 409, M2M-safe delete, audited create/update/delete); web page
  = add/edit modal (code·%·max-uses·expiry·flags) + delete + PageHeader. (was list + toggle.)
- ✅ **Automation**: read-only **broadcast monitor/cancel** + **alert run-now/preview/config**
  (texts·colours·cadence). **Broadcast compose/start intentionally NOT in the web** — stays bot-only
  via `/broadcast` + `/forward` (reply → command), which is simpler and keeps Telegram's native
  premium-emoji editor (owner decision).
- ✅ **Texts**: tabbed by area (general/sales/support/access/alerts) + search; per-card save +
  variables + premium-emoji helper. Backend adds `group` to each curated key.
- ✅ **Audit**: added **date-range** filter (`start`/`end`) + **CSV export** (current filters,
  up to 1000 rows) + PageHeader; detail drawer + source/search filters already existed.
- ✅ **Force-join editor** (super-admin): `GET`/`PUT /settings/force-join` read/replace the
  `force_join_chats` dict (key = chat id/@username for the membership check, value = public username
  for the join link); web = a self-contained editor card on the Settings page (add/remove rows, save
  → `settings:dirty` reload). Audited `settings.force_join`.
- ✅ **Payment-gateway config** shipped (NowPayments + Plisio + offline — see Done log).
  Card-to-card web config = Now #1. **P10 done.**

### P11 — UI/UX overhaul (web) — split foundation vs polish

**P11a (foundation) — ⏳ in progress:**

- ✅ Calendar-aware dates: `utils/datetime.ts` (Intl, no dep — Jalali/Gregorian) + header toggle;
  `fmtDate` is now calendar-aware so existing pages follow the choice; live via layout re-render.
- ✅ Font setting: `theme.FONTS` (Vazirmatn default · Vazir · Sahel · Samim · System, loaded in
  index.html) + header font picker; persisted (localStorage); applied via AntD token + body.
- ✅ `components/PageHeader.tsx` (consistent title/subtitle/actions) — adopt across pages in P5+.
- [ ] Remaining: tab/section shell + breadcrumbs adoption; move font/calendar defaults into a
  Settings "Appearance" tab (server-side). (Responsive table→card + dashboard widgets shipped
  in P11b.)

**P11b (polish):**

- ✅ **Shared `StatCard`** — polished KPI card whose value uses the **inherited (configured) font**
  + tabular-nums (fixes the hard-coded-mono bug where dashboard/report numbers ignored the font
  picker).
- ✅ **Dashboard redesign — minimal/modern** (neumorphism dropped per owner): hover KPI cards
  (lift + shadow, **hover colour = theme accent**, gray→accent icon chips), soft 14px corners,
  configured-font numbers. **14-day bar chart** with hover tooltips + **sibling-fade** (others dim
  on hover) + Jalali axis. **Switchable summary** (Today / 7d / 30d Segmented) showing income /
  sales / orders / **GB sold** — backend `/dashboard/summary` gained `period_today/week/month`
  (`PeriodStat`: income·sales·orders·gb via `Sum(service__data_limit)`). Fixed mislabel
  (active subscriptions, not "active users"). Responsive (xs→xl).
- ✅ **Global button/link polish** (index.css): smooth transitions + subtle primary-button lift.
- ✅ **Shell redesign** (Layout.tsx): **collapsible** desktop sidebar (icon-only mini mode, persisted)
  + drawer on mobile; **consolidated "Appearance" dropdown** in the header (theme · language ·
  calendar · accent · font — declutters the toolbar) keyed to the theme accent; added a **footer**;
  responsive header (xs→xl). Dashboard ops KPIs now wrap to multiple rows on desktop.
- ✅ **Cohesion pass**: moved the shared card/chart CSS into `index.css` (`.stat-card`/`.stat-icon`
  hover-lift + theme-accent icon; `.bars`/`.chart-bar` sibling-fade). `StatCard` upgraded to that
  style; dashboard + reports now share one card + bar-chart look (reports KPIs + chart hover too).
- ✅ **List pages cohesion**: `PageHeader` (title + subtitle + search-in-extra) added to Users,
  Subscriptions, Transactions — now consistent with Services/Servers/Discounts/Resellers/Audit/Texts.
- ✅ **Config pages cohesion**: `PageHeader` added to **menus / buttons / settings / automation**
  (replacing ad-hoc `Title`/`Paragraph` headers). Buttons/Settings full-page `Spin` → **Skeleton**;
  automation `Spin` → Skeleton.
- ✅ **Font fix (IDs/numbers)**: `.mono` no longer hard-pins IBM Plex Mono — it now inherits the
  configured UI font with `tabular-nums` (fixes Users-page IDs etc. ignoring the font picker);
  automation stat numbers de-hardcoded the same way.
- ✅ **Responsive table→card on mobile**: new `ResponsiveTable` (auto-builds a stacked card per row
  from the existing `columns`, label=title/value=render; action columns → card footer) + `useIsMobile`
  hook (AntD `< md`). Adopted on Users, Subscriptions, Transactions, Services, Servers, Discounts,
  Resellers, Audit, Menus. Includes skeleton + empty states on mobile.
- ✅ **Detail pages polish** (users/resellers `show`): already tabbed (Overview / Subs / Payments /
  Logs / Children) + `PageHeader` with back button; now full-page `Spin` → **Skeleton** and inner
  tab tables → `ResponsiveTable` (mobile card view in tabs too).
- ✅ **Theme presets + density**: Appearance menu gained **one-click presets** (Emerald Dark/Light,
  Ocean Dark, Violet Dark, Rose/Amber Light — each sets accent + mode together) and a **density**
  toggle (Default / Compact via AntD `compactAlgorithm`). Both persisted (localStorage `density`);
  context gained `setMode`/`density`/`setDensity`; `makeTheme(accent, mode, font, density)`.
- ✅ **Reports redesign**: `StatCard` KPI row, gradient bar chart + **Jalali x-axis labels**,
  payment-breakdown with **% share bars**, empty states; date range + presets + CSV export kept.
- ✅ **Reports — richer stats**: added **GB sold** (range), an **All-time totals** block (total
  sales / income / orders / users / GB) and a **Subscription (proxy) stats** block (total + per
  status: active / on_hold / disabled / limited / expired with % share). Backend `/reports/summary`
  gained `gb_sold`, `all_*`, `proxies_total/active`, `proxies_by_status` (`_gb` helper via
  `Sum(service__data_limit)`; status counts loop `ProxyStatus`). CSV export includes them.
- ✅ **Jalali date-range picker**: when the calendar pref is **Shamsi**, the reports range picker
  switches to a **dependency-free** `JalaliRangePicker` (year/month/day Selects, Shamsi months) that
  emits Gregorian Dayjs — query stays Gregorian ISO. Conversion in new `utils/jalali.ts` (inlined
  jalaali-js, no new npm dep, consistent with the Intl-based `utils/datetime.ts`).
- ✅ **Panel-health + low-balance dashboard widget**: lazy, self-contained `PanelHealth` card
  (own skeleton + manual refresh) → `GET /dashboard/panel-health` live-pings each **enabled** panel
  (`build_panel().get_admin()` with an 8s timeout, concurrent via `asyncio.gather`) and reads the
  **Guardino reseller balance** (`get_balance`), colour-coded vs the warn/critical thresholds (read
  from `BotSetting`, defaults mirrored). Errors reduced to non-sensitive codes (auth/unreachable/
  error) — no panel URL/creds leak. Kept off `/dashboard/summary` so the summary stays fast.
- [ ] Remaining: micro-interactions, broader audit.

### P12 — Bot (Telegram) UX overhaul — ✅ done

Goal: the customer-facing bot looks premium and converts better (customers browse/buy here).

- ✅ **Subscription view — usage bar**: the proxy detail card gained a text data-usage bar
  (`▰▰▰▱▱ ۶۳٪`, Persian digits, in `<code>` for alignment) + "used / total" line (or "نامحدود ♾") +
  `max(0, …)` remaining. New `helpers.usage_bar()` / `helpers.fa_num()` (empty bar for unlimited).
  Header/usage are now built via list-join so **no stray blank lines** on unlimited plans.
- ~~Tariffs overview in the purchase list~~ — **reverted** at owner's request: the plan buttons
  already convey name·price·data·duration, so the extra text block was redundant + cluttered. The
  `purchase_show_tariffs` setting was removed cleanly (model/API/schema/web/locale; row auto-pruned
  on startup, no migration).
- ✅ **Empty-state CTA**: "my subscriptions" with no subs now shows a friendly message + an inline
  **🛒 خرید اشتراک** button (packs `Services.Callback(action=show)` → straight into the buy flow)
  instead of a dead-end toast. Admins viewing an empty child list keep the plain notice. Also fixed
  the old un-awaited `qmsg.answer(...)` returns here.
- ✅ **Account page — dashboard-style**: restructured into identity / financial / postpaid sections
  with clear separators; shows **active / total subscriptions** from the **local** `Proxy.status`
  (fixed the old "active services" label that actually counted *all* proxies) — cheap, no panel
  calls. Quick actions stay (the `UserPanel` keyboard). *Nearest expiry deferred — expiry isn't
  stored locally (panel-only), so it'd need per-panel calls.*
- ✅ **New-user onboarding**: `/start` for a user with **0 subscriptions** now follows the menu with
  a concise welcome + inline **🛒 خرید اشتراک** CTA (packs the buy callback). Cheap count, skipped on
  `start_only` deep links, no new copy/migration.
- ✅ **Insufficient-balance clarity**: the purchase confirmation now states the exact **shortfall**
  (`💳 مبلغ قابل پرداخت: price − balance`) so the customer sees precisely what to pay (it was only
  passed to the pay button before). One line, no clutter.
- ✅ Purchase/renew flow polish (steps, success screen, empty states/hints, iconography, copy) —
  done + owner-verified on deploy. **P12 done.**
- All copy editable via the Texts editor (P10).

### P13 — Smart alerts v2: timing + pro control

Was: cron `hour="6,16"` only → an "ended" alert could lag ~10h (the owner's complaint).

- ✅ **Hourly cadence** — `proxy_alerts` now runs `cron minute=0` (top of every hour), so
  ended/limited/expiry fire within ~1h (was twice-daily). Sender stays non-blocking: batched
  `get_users`, ~20 msg/s throttle, `TelegramRetryAfter` sleep-retry, blocked-recipient handling.
- ✅ **Quiet hours** — `_in_quiet()` defers sends during a configurable Iran-local window
  (`alerts_quiet_enabled` / `alerts_quiet_start_hour` / `alerts_quiet_end_hour`, default 23→8,
  UTC+3:30). Self-healing dedup means a deferred alert simply fires the next active hour.
- ✅ **Multi-step expiry** — opt-in `notify_expiry_steps_hours` (e.g. `[72,24,12]` = 3d/1d/12h),
  per-step dedup via `Proxy.notified` keys `expiry:{h}`; the loop sends only the tightest new step
  and marks looser already-passed steps as seen (no stale "3 days left" after "12 hours left").
  Empty list → legacy single step from `notify_expiry_days` (**no behaviour change by default**).
- ✅ **Web-editable** — new settings surfaced in web **Settings → Alerts** (quiet switch + start/end
  hours + expiry-steps tags); API `_BOOL/_INT/_LIST` + `SettingsOut/UpdateIn` extended; bot
  `Settings` model + validator added (rows auto-created on startup, no migration).
- ✅ **Send-now from web** — Automation page got an **Alerts** card: "Run now" (`POST
  /automation/alerts/run` sets Redis `alerts:run_now`; the bot's 15s `sync_settings` poll picks it
  up and fires `proxy_alerts(force=True)` in the background, **bypassing quiet hours**) + live
  last-run status (`GET /automation/alerts` reads the `alerts:status` hash the job writes:
  state/last_run/sent). 409 guard while a scan is running. API never imports the bot.
- ✅ **Alert preview** — Automation Alerts card "Preview" button opens a modal showing each of the 4
  templates (`alert_expiry/low_data/unused/ended`) rendered with sample placeholder values in a
  Telegram-style bubble. `GET /automation/alerts/preview` reads `BotText` directly (no bot import),
  substitutes `{NAME}/{DAYS_LEFT}/{DATA_LEFT}`, flags empty rows as "uses bot default".
- ✅ **Per-type re-send cadence** — `alerts_cadence_{expiry,low_data,unused,ended}_hours` (0 = once,
  default; N = re-remind every N h while the condition holds). Enforced per-proxy via timestamps in
  `Proxy.notified` (`{flag: last_sent_ts}`, legacy bool tolerated); `_cadence`/`_base_of` helpers.
- ✅ **Automation alert-config hub** (super-admin) — `GET/PATCH /automation/alerts/config`: edit the
  4 alert **texts** (→ BotText), the 2 alert glass-button **colour + premium emoji** (→ merged into
  `button_icons`/`button_styles`, never clobbering other buttons) + the inline-premium master switch,
  and the per-type **cadence**. Sets both `texts:dirty`+`settings:dirty`. Web: collapsible
  `AlertConfig` card on the Automation page (lazy-loads on expand, super-admin only).
- [ ] Deferred (low value): the bot settings-FSM mirror. **P13 done.**

## Active phase details

### Phase 2 — Web panel UX (✅ absorbed by P11)

Theme accents + Settings tabs shipped here; detail-page tabs, skeletons/empty-states and the
responsiveness pass all shipped later under P11a/P11b — nothing remains.

### Phase 3 — Premium emoji + colour on inline buttons (✅ built + verified on deploy)

Bot API `icon_custom_emoji_id` + `style` on inline (glass) buttons — NOT reply buttons.
Master switch `premium_buttons_enabled` defaults **OFF** → zero behaviour change until owner opts in.
Custom emoji icon needs the **bot owner to have Telegram Premium**; `style` colour does not.

- Helper `app/keyboards/premium.py:premium_button(...)` — injects extras only when enabled,
  build-time try/except fallback to a plain button (a rejecting/old API never breaks the UI).
- `app/utils/buttons.py`: `INLINE_BUTTONS` registry (9 keys) + `DEFAULT_STYLES` +
  `resolve_icon/resolve_style`. Config: `button_icons` / `button_styles` (key→value Settings rows, no migration).
- Applied to alert keyboards + 6 `ProxyPanel` action buttons (`app/keyboards/user/proxy.py`).
- Web: `pages/buttons/index.tsx` 2 tabs (Main-menu labels · Inline premium); router
  `app/api/routers/buttons.py` + schemas (`InlineButtonItem`, `ButtonsOut.inline/premium_enabled`).

✅ Owner-verified on a real deploy: premium emoji icons + button colours render correctly —
aiogram 3.4.1 serialises the fields (no raw-payload sender needed).

- ✅ **Double-emoji fix:** when a premium icon is applied, `buttons.strip_leading_emoji` drops
  the text's own leading emoji so the icon doesn't duplicate it (`app/keyboards/premium.py`).
- ✅ **Inline rename:** `button_texts` setting + per-button text field in the web Buttons page
  (Inline tab). Renaming is NOT premium-gated — any admin can relabel an inline button.

### Phase 4 — Full button customization (✅ done — 4c dropped)

Goal owner asked for: edit **every** bot button (text + premium emoji + colour), create **new**
buttons with **actions**, group them into **sections**, and fully customize the **main reply
menu** (the post-/start buttons that drive customer first-impression + retention). Big +
architectural → build per stage, confirm each before starting.

- **4a — Cover inline buttons** ✅ (customer-facing): `INLINE_BUTTONS` now covers account /
  purchase / payment / renew / proxy-panel (rename + emoji + colour). Admin keyboards **out of
  scope** (owner decision). Remaining customer back/confirm/reserve buttons → 4a (cont.) above.
- **4a (payment methods)** ✅: the charge-menu gateway buttons (card-to-card / crypto / perfect-money
  / zarinpal / zibal / payping / aqaye-pardakht / swapino / tron) are now keyed
  (`pay_method_key(plugin._name)` → `pay_*` registry entries) and routed through `premium_button` in
  `keyboards/user/payment.ChargePanel`, so each gets colour + premium emoji (+ optional rename) in the
  web Buttons editor. Web labels added; the inline tab gained a **search filter** for the longer list.
- **Editor UX redesign** ✅: **Texts editor** — variable tags are now **clickable to insert** `{VAR}`
  at the cursor, a **live HTML preview** toggle per text (Telegram-style bubble), + a char counter.
  **Buttons editor** — the inline list is **grouped by category** (proxy / account / purchase /
  payment / renew / links / reset / reserve / alerts / common) with the search filtering across
  groups, so the now ~40-button list stays navigable.
- **4b — Main reply-menu builder** ✅: `main_menu_layout` setting (ordered rows of keys, empty =
  default) drives `keyboards/base.MainMenu`. Web editor (Buttons → Main-menu tab): enable/disable
  (remove = hide), reorder (↑↓), row grouping (↵ new-row), + the existing per-button label/emoji.
  Routing stays text-based (no handler change); super-admins always keep the admin button.
  Per-button premium `icon_custom_emoji_id` is inline-only, so reply buttons use unicode emoji in
  the label. `sync_settings.py` reloads via `settings:dirty`. No migration (key-value setting).
- **4c — Dynamic custom buttons + actions** — ⛔ dropped (owner decision, 2026-07): not needed.

---

## Done log (compact — don't rebuild these)

- ✅ **Crypto v2 — Plisio + NowPayments (live)** — shared rate service `crypto/rates.py` (Nobitex
  USDT/toman, Redis cache, margin %, manual fallback); crypto `currency+amount` invoices, premium
  pay/check/cancel buttons, tracking codes; **idempotent finalizers** (`plisio_service` /
  `nowpayments_service`) shared by IPN + manual check + auto-check — **mismatch never
  auto-credits**; NowPayments IPN signature **mandatory**; `is_fixed_rate` default OFF; optional
  `pay_currency` validated against merchant coins. ⚠️ The NowPayments **IPN secret must be set**
  or crediting (correctly) won't run. Env: `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `PLISIO_*`, `PAYMENT_RATE_*`,
  `MANUAL_USDT_TOMAN_RATE`.
- ✅ **Web payment-gateway config** — `GET/PATCH /payment-gateways` + `pages/gateways`
  (super-admin, audited): NowPayments + Plisio enable/title/min/keys/currency/rate; secrets
  masked (read = is_set+last4, empty save = no change). ⚠️ Enabling Plisio needs one bot restart.
- ✅ **Offline crypto gateway** — web-configured `CoinWallet` list; coin → wallet+QR →
  TXID+screenshot (accumulated in any order); super-admin approve/reject **stateful card** + web
  pending-review (Redis queue → single credit path `apply_offline_review`); reject-after-approve
  reverses credit + removes the sub. Reuses `CryptoPayment(offline)` → no migration. On-chain
  auto-check dropped (owner). In-bot `pm:settings` screens for plisio/offline added.
- ✅ **Admin glass buttons** — the 8 ⚙️ `AdminPanel` buttons route through `premium_button`
  (`admin_*` keys) → customizable in the web Buttons editor.
- ✅ **Multi-bot installer** `installer/guardino-bot.sh` (CLI `guardino-bot`) — shared platform
  (MariaDB+Redis+Caddy+phpMyAdmin) + isolated per-bot stacks (own DB/REDIS_DB/subdomain), per-bot
  backup/restore, registry. **Owner-verified on a real VPS — multiple bots end-to-end.**
  Guide → `docs/multi-bot.md`.
- ✅ **Broadcast** — non-blocking worker `app/utils/broadcast.py` (throttle, retry-after, resume
  from Redis cursor); compose stays bot-only (`/broadcast` + `/forward`); web = monitor/cancel.
- ✅ **Bug-fix plan `delightful-crafting-micali.md`** — all verified on deploy (PasarGuard
  add-server `is_sudo`, edit-service inbounds check, Guardino sub-day expiry, FSM clear,
  month=31d, panel-aware admin menus).
- ✅ **Topics-group reporting** — `app/utils/reports.py` (`ReportTopic` ×8: financial/orders/test/
  backup/nightly/errors/new-users/misc) routes all admin reports into a forum supergroup, one topic
  each; admin setup in bot settings ("گروه گزارشات") auto-creates topics; group **replaces** legacy
  transaction/orders-log channels when set (legacy behavior when unset — safe update, settings are
  key-value → no migration). Financial reports show method/provider/destination-card/admin +
  accept/reject (card-to-card, offline, gateways). New jobs: `nightly_report` (00:15 Tehran,
  previous-day stats, pinned: orders/renews/volume/money-by-method/top-buyers/per-server) +
  `backup_report` (mysqldump→gzip→topic on a settings interval; needs mariadb-client in the
  image → rebuild). Catch-all `dp.error` + FastAPI 500 handler feed the errors topic (sanitized).
  **Connect UX**: primary = one-tap — promote the bot to admin in a forum group → it posts a
  connect button (`handlers/admin/reports_group.py`, my_chat_member); manual group-id entry stays
  as fallback. **Bot is now silent in groups** (ACL drops non-private message updates; callbacks +
  my_chat_member still pass — needed for receipt review & connect). ACL's KeyError-double-run bug
  fixed in the same change. **Web panel**: settings page card (GET/PATCH `/settings/reports-group`,
  per-topic switches, nightly toggle, backup interval, disconnect) + test actions (test message per
  topic / run-nightly / backup-now) via POST `/settings/reports-group/test` → Redis queue
  `reports:web:actions` drained by the bot's 15s sync poll.
- ✅ **Multi-panel adapter** (`app/panels/`, `docs/panels.md`) — Marzban (legacy) + **PasarGuard complete**
  (data-plane + admin UI + webhook). New code never imports a panel client directly.
- ✅ **Guardino Hub** (panel adapter, phase 2) — id-based, GB/days, hub pricing. Stages 0–4: model +
  migration 47, adapter, admin UX, purchase/manage, low-balance job. ⛔ reserves + efficient
  sync + on_hold deferred. ⚠️ 2FA must be OFF on the bot's hub account.
- ✅ **Web panel Phase 1** — FastAPI `app/api/` (`api` service, uvicorn :8000) + `webpanel/`
  (Vite + React + Refine + AntD, RTL, served by nginx :8080, proxies `/api`). Telegram-OTP +
  Web-App auto-login → JWT. Routers: dashboard, users(+block), proxies(+action/delete),
  services, servers(+health/enabled), transactions, reports, resellers, discounts,
  automation(broadcast monitor+cancel), settings, audit, texts, menus, buttons. Reseller
  subtree scoping; credentials never exposed; **no manual sell** (purchases/renew stay bot-only).
- ✅ **Audit log** — `AuditLog` (`app/models/audit.py`, migration **48**) + `app/utils/audit.record_audit`
  (model-layer, API-safe). Every web write-action + key bot admin actions (balance ops, server/
  service add·edit·delete) recorded with actor+role+source+target+amount. Purpose: catch
  financial abuse when a third-party super-admin runs the bot on the owner's panel.
- ✅ **Settings parity** — curated `settings` router writes `BotSetting` directly + `settings:dirty`
  → `app/jobs/sync_settings.py` reloads the bot. Covers access/referral/buttons/reminders/
  username_generator/log-channels/charge-lists/alerts. `payment_*` excluded (secrets).
- ✅ **Texts / Menus / Button-labels editors** — `/texts` (`texts:dirty` reload; `<tg-emoji>` in
  message text), `/menus` (nested ServiceMenu CRUD, cycle-safe), `/buttons` (main-menu labels via
  `button_labels` + `app/middlewares/button_labels.py` remap). All super-admin.
- ✅ **Phase 1 — Smart proxy alerts** — `app/jobs/proxy_alerts.py` (cron `hour="6,16"`),
  migration **49** adds `Proxy.notified` JSON. Batch `get_users`, evaluates expiry-soon /
  low-data / unused / ended with **self-healing dedup** (flag drops when condition clears).
  Throttled non-blocking send + glass renew/links buttons. 4 Persian templates (`texts.alert_*`)
  + 9 settings, both editable in the web panel.
- ✅ **Phase 4a/4b — Button customization (customer-facing)** — inline rename + premium emoji +
  colour across account/purchase/payment/renew/proxy-panel; double-emoji auto-fix; main reply-menu
  builder (`main_menu_layout`: enable/disable + reorder + row layout). Web Buttons page (2 tabs).
  Admin buttons out of scope. No migration (key-value settings).
- ✅ **Per-service + per-category button premium** — `Service.button_icon`/`button_style`
  (migration **50**) and `ServiceMenu.button_icon`/`button_style` (migration **51**) let a named
  service OR a menu/category carry a premium emoji + colour on its button. Service: main reply
  menu (`base.MainMenu`, no emoji-strip → text routing intact) + inline purchase/renew lists.
  Menu/category: inline purchase/renew lists (callback-routed → emoji-strip safe). Both via
  defensive 4-tuples `(id, name, icon, style)`. Edited from the web Services page (modal →
  `PATCH /services/{id}/button`, audit `service.button`) and the web Menus form (existing
  `POST`/`PATCH /menus`, normalized + audited). Bot reads the rows live (no reload flag).
- ✅ **Phase 4 — Colour model + experimental reply premium** — inline colours now raw-by-default
  (only important buttons coloured); web 5-state style picker (default/raw/blue/green/red, `none`
  sentinel = forced no-colour). Main (reply) menu premium emoji/colour behind a separate
  `premium_reply_enabled` flag with build-time fallback + `main_menu_routing_map` so emoji-stripped
  labels still route. Decoupled from inline so it can't break the menu.
- ✅ **Fix** — reseller test-service counting (`record_purchase_service` uses `user.role`;
  unified Redis key + `count >= limit`).

## Locked decisions (don't re-litigate)

- **No manual sell in the web panel** — purchases/renew stay bot-only (user-centric; avoids
  free-provisioning on the owner's panel). Web = manage / support / report / customise + audit.
- **Web panel goal is bot operations, not re-creating upstream panels** (Guardino Hub etc.).
  Cover sales/management/support/reporting through the same panel adapter for all three panels.
- **Premium buttons** default OFF; safe fallback always; inline-only; emoji needs owner Premium.
- **Button customization targets the customer UI only** — admin buttons + the ⚙️ admin-panel
  menu are deliberately NOT made premium/customizable (focus is customer attraction/retention).
- **Premium emoji/colour on the main (reply) menu is EXPERIMENTAL** — the `KeyboardButton`
  schema this code was written against doesn't list `icon_custom_emoji_id`/`style`, but (per an
  owner-supplied doc + the fact inline used undocumented fields that proved real) it's
  implemented behind a **separate** flag `premium_reply_enabled` (default OFF), with a build-time
  fallback. ⚠️ The fallback CANNOT catch a Telegram **send-time** rejection, so it's deliberately
  decoupled from the proven inline `premium_buttons_enabled` flag — enabling inline never risks
  the menu send. If Telegram rejects the fields, the owner just turns the reply flag off.
- **Inline colours are raw by default** — only important buttons carry a built-in colour (green
  for money/confirm CTAs, red for destructive). Web style picker has 5 states: default
  (recommended = built-in), raw (`none` = force no colour), blue (`primary`), green (`success`),
  red (`danger`).
- **Backend FastAPI + Frontend React/Refine/AntD** (RTL, Vazirmatn, emerald, dark+light, responsive).
- **The API process must never import `app.main`** (it pulls payment plugins). Routers touch
  `BotSetting`/`BotText` directly + dirty-flags.
- Guardino: hub owns base price; bot keeps retail margin. Pre-check with `quote`; never assume
  per-day cost. Link policy admin-configurable (master vs node). Low-balance thresholds in settings.
- **Plan/price CRUD in the web is allowed** (defining plans ≠ selling). The "no manual sell" rule
  only forbids provisioning a subscription from the web; purchases/renew stay bot-only.
- **User/reseller display = numeric id ALWAYS + username next to it** (owner: id is required for
  audits; username is for readability). Search by either.
- **Dates: Jalali (Shamsi) alongside Gregorian** in the web panel — a global toggle + per-Settings
  default; one shared date util (dayjs + jalaali); applies to tables, detail pages, and report ranges.
- **Web fonts are user-selectable** (Vazirmatn default + Vazir + others) from Settings; persisted.
